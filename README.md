The idea behind MealMaker is to create and track meals for diet/nutritional/medical purposes.

The ultimate goal is for the user to be able to create a meal, include basic nutritional information about the foods in that meal, and be able to track how often/how many times the user has eaten a particular meal.

Over time, the user will generate a database of meal options (i.e. - What should I eat for dinner tonight?) that also contains relevant nutritional information (How good/bad is it for me and how does it fit in with my overall healt/diet goals?).

Nutritional information for foods/ingredients will include things like fat content, sugar content, glycemic index, protein, etc.
